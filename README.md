This is the midterm project I completed with Ryan Chan for the "Applied Statistical Modeling" course at Vassar College.
We examined potential predictors of airfare by performing multiple linear regression modeling on a sample of 400 U.S. domestic flights;
and found that market distance, willingness to pay, and itinerary region type are significant predictors of airfare in the U.S.
The course was taught by [Prof. Ming-Wen An](http://pages.vassar.edu/mian/) in Fall 2015.
